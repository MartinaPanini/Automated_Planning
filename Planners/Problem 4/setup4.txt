- All the artifacts are in the hall alpha or hall beta. 
- All the pods are in the pods room. 
- There can be multiple robots in the entrance. 
- There is different kinds of robotic curators (e.g., robotic curators with different capabilities or drones). So we have to consider the capacity and the kind of robotic curator.
- Each robot can move in any room.
- Each robot can pick up more than one artifact at a time, but they have a maximum capacity.
- Each robot can load only one artifact in a pod at a time.
- To pick up an artifact from hall beta, the robot have to pick a pod, then go to pick the artifact beta and put it into the pod before  trasporting it. 
- Before picking up an artifact from hall beta, the robot have to check if there is sismic activity. If there is, the robot have to wait until the seismic activity is over or pick a artifact from hall alpha.
- When the robot performs the unload of artefact beta  from the pod in the stasis lab, then it have to return the pod in the pod room.

Action to do in parallel:
- Two diffierents curators can pick up diferrents artifacts at the same time.
- Two differents curators cannot pickup and tranport the same artifact at the same time.

Consider that the robotic curators have the folloowing goals:
• Retrieve Artifacts from Artifact Hall β (only accessible outside seismic windows).
• Place retrieved artifacts into an Anti-Vibration Pod before transporting them.
• Transfer artifacts Artifact Hall α to the CryoChamber, ensuring their temperature never rises above a threshold (requires cooling them).
• Relocate the Martian Core Samples from the CryoChamber to the Stasis-Lab

The goal of problem 2 should be that the artifacts are moved to their respective destinations, following the constraints discussed above.
