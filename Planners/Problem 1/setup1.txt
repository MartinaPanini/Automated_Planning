All the artifacts are in the hall alpha or hall beta. 
All the pods are in the pods room. 
There is a single robot in the entrance. 
The robot can move in any room.
The robot can pick up only one artifact at a time.
The robot can load only one artifact in a pod at a time.
To pick up an artifact from hall beta, the robot have to pick a 
pod, then go to pick the artifact beta and put it into the pod before 
trasporting it. 
Before picking up an artifact from hall beta, the robot have to 
check if there is sismic activity. If there is, the robot have to wait 
until the seismic activity is over or pick a artifact from hall alpha.


Consider that the robotic curators have the folloowing goals:
• Retrieve Artifacts from Artifact Hall β (only accessi-
ble outside seismic windows).
• Place retrieved artifacts into an Anti-Vibration Pod
before transporting them.
• Transfer artifacts Artifact Hall α to the Cryo-
Chamber, ensuring their temperature never rises
above a threshold (requires cooling them).
• Relocate the Martian Core Samples from the Cryo-
Chamber to the Stasis-Lab

The goal of problem 1 should be that the artifacts are moved to
their respective destinations, following the constraints dis-
cussed above.
